# orp-weed

ORP Weed is a weed growing resources that allows players to grow weed anywhere out in the city that they'd like. Plants are saved and stored within a database so growing continues while offline or after restarts.
This is a script from my framework that I've decided to convert over to ESX as I've not released anything in a while.

## Main Features
* Grow weed anywhere in the city (Go find hidden locations)
* Limited to growing 12 crops at any given time
* Easy changable configuration to your liking
* Police can destroy plants if they come across them
* Plant stats (Hunger, growth, quality etc) for individual plants
* Different types of seeds with rarities
* Optimized code (Unless 100's of plants are in your face it shouldnt effect performance)

### Installing
1. Add orp-weed to your resources folder
2. Upload orpweed.sql to your database
3. Add orp-weed to your server.cfg
